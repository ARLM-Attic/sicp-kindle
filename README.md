#### Slight reformatting of the pages at

http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html

1 - I got the source:

<pre>
      wget -r http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html
</pre>

2 - used ~~hpricot~~ Nokogiri to:

* remove 'navigation' divs
* insert <code>&lt;mbp:pagebreak /&gt;</code> tags at the top of each html body to keep lines from getting split at page-breaks

3 - removed cover page 'book.html' since there's already a cover image

4 - set text-indent: 0 for <code>p</code> tags, since kindle indents about 1em by default, which deformatted the code snips ( <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;</code> is used instead of <code>pre</code> )

5 - set height="2em" on div tags in 'References' section (kindle doesn't support the CSS for controlling this)

6 - added jump table to top of index

7 - built opf and ncx with ruby.  toc.ncx allows 'nav points' for the 5-way kindle knob to get you from chapter to chapter

### Notes on building the book

The old build of <code>sicp.mobi</code> in this repo seems to work fine.  But if you want or need to build it yourself, you need to:

1. generate the input <code>opf</code> xml, so your build has a current date.
2. run that input through 'kindlegen' to produce a large but functional book
3. optionally strip out the source that kindlegen includes in the output using '[kindlestrip.py](https://github.com/jefftriplett/kindlestrip)'

#### Building the Book

* install 'kindlegen' somewhere in your path.
* make sure you have Ruby 1.8.7 or later
* make sure you have the <code>Rake</code> gem

<pre>
     $ cd ~/sicp-kindle
     # to build the book
     $ rake build
     # or just
     $ rake

     # to clean up the output artifacts
     $ rake clean

     # to see the available tasks
     $ rake -T

     # if you just want to see what the XML looks like,
     # generate it like this:
     $ rake artifacts/toc.ncx artifacts/sicp.opf
</pre>

When you build, You'll see this for a few minutes:

<pre>
    mkdir -p artifacts
    generating artifacts/toc.ncx
    generating artifacts/sicp.opf
    running: 'kindlegen artifacts/sicp.opf -c2 -verbose > artifacts/kindlegen.log'

    writing to: artifacts/sicp.mobi . . .
</pre>

Then probably this:

<pre>
    Warnings when building book, see $HOME/sicp-kindle/content/mobi.out.txt for information
</pre>

The warnings refer to unresolved links that seem to have no affect on the formatting or navigability of the book itself.  They won't go away until someone debugs the HTML, but there doesn't seem to be any reason to.

#### Stripping the Source

To deflate the output size by stripping out the <code>opf</code> xml source that Amazon must have some reason for including, yet removes when they publish in their store anyway, use Paul Durrant's python script which can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jefftriplett/kindlestrip).  Note that you only really need the file 'kindlestrip.py' from Jeff Triplett's repo.

e.g.,

<pre>
    # the third arg to the python script is optional
    $ ./kindlestrip.py sicp.mobi small.mobi removed-source.log
    $ mv small.mobi sicp.mobi
</pre>

### Interested in reformatting?

If you start with pristine HTML source from MIT (see links above), there is a <code>FixHTMLSource</code> module in the script that uses Nokogiri as an HTML parser to add mobi pagebreaks.
You could build on that tiny amount of code to manipulate the source however you see fit.  Nokogiri is a joy to use for such work, though installation of the gem has historically been tricky depending on the state of your local <code>libxsl</code> dependencies.
Note that Nokogiri is required only at runtime in <code>FixHTMLSource</code> now, so most users of the script will never run into it.


### TODO

Read the damn book!
